## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install development dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
sudo apt install python3-pyqt6 python3-psutil
sudo apt install git build-essential
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sidekick-screensaver.git
cd sidekick-screensaver

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Testing Your Changes
```bash
# Run the application
python3 screensaver_preferences.py

# Test installation script
sudo bash Sidekick_Installer.sh

# Run verification
./verify_installation.sh
./verify-show-stats
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and small

### Code Organization
```python
# Good function structure
def calculate_drift_position(self, screen_width, screen_height):
    """Calculate current drift position for stats display.

    Args:
        screen_width (int): Screen width in pixels
        screen_height (int): Screen height in pixels

    Returns:
        tuple: (x, y) position for stats display
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### GUI Development
- Use PyQt6 best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Ensure widgets are properly destroyed
- Test on different screen sizes

### System Integration
- Check for required dependencies
- Handle missing system components gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Test on multiple Linux distributions

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] GUI launches without errors
- [ ] All screensaver modes work correctly
- [ ] System tray icon persists after interruption
- [ ] Settings are saved and loaded correctly
- [ ] Installation script completes successfully
- [ ] Autostart functionality works
- [ ] USB detection interrupts screensaver
- [ ] Stats display and drift work properly

### Test Environments
Please test on:
- Different Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)
- Various desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, LXDE)
- Multiple screen configurations
- Different Python versions (3.7+)
