# Sidekick Screensaver

> *"Necessity is the mother of all invention"* - and sometimes you just need to know if your Pi has crashed.

## The Story Behind Sidekick

What started as a simple need became a full-featured solution. When running critical automation systems on Raspberry Pi, visual feedback is essential - but finding a reliable screensaver for Wayland environments proved surprisingly challenging. Traditional X11 screensavers don't play well with modern Wayland compositors, leaving a gap in the ecosystem.

Rather than compromise, this project was born from the collaboration between practical necessity and modern development tools. Built with the assistance of GitHub Copilot and leveraging proven open-source libraries, Sidekick Screensaver bridges the gap between system monitoring and visual appeal.

What emerged is more than just a "crash detector" - it's a sophisticated screensaver system that combines real-time system statistics, anti-burn-in technology, and eye-catching visual effects. From Matrix-style digital rain to hypnotic geometric patterns, Sidekick proves that utilitarian software doesn't have to sacrifice style.

*Because every developer deserves to know their system is alive - and it might as well look good doing it.*
